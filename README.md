# Hi, I'm Septian Dowongi (aka limploc) 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile.
I'm a software developer with a passion for clean code and clean lifts.

💻 Focus: Backend development, automation, system design

### 🏋️‍♂️ Outside the terminal
Barbells, compound lifts, and quiet discipline.  
Tech and training — both under load, both for life.
